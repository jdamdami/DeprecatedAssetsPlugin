The Deprecated Assets Plugin is an Unreal Engine plugin that allows users in a project to mark an asset as deprecated and set a replacement asset that should be use instead.

If another user tries to use an asset marked as deprecated, an error message will pop up to warn the user and show the replacement asset that should be use instead

It is currently working on UE 5.6.1
